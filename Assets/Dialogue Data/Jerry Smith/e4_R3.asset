  - "Smith: Oh, o-okay. I forgot to set the alarm, so I was late to work. Luckily,
    the boss didn\u2019t notice. I immediately started working. After about an hour,
    the boss called me to his office."
  - "Smith:  I was terrified he\u2019d find out that I was late to work. But it was
    just a weekly employee check. I ate lunch with Mr. Wilbur, Kurt, and Albert in
    the parts storage. After that, I left the factory like everyone else at 6 pm."
  - 'Odd: Did you see anything unusual?'
  - 'Smith: No, I was focused on my work. I need to work hard to finish my internship
    and get better pay. My sisters are hungry.'
