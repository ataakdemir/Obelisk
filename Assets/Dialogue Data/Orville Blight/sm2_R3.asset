  dialogue:
  - 'Blight: I came to work and had lunch with the others. I left the factory for
    my meetings. The meeting was on the bottom floor. Being so close to the Underground
    is very terrifying.'
  - "Blight: Even I can\u2019t focus on work with all the noise from starving, jobless,
    dirty people. Luckily, our security takes care of them. There is no law down
    there."
  - 'Blight: We can shoot them without a worry. I came to the factory, checked the
    inventory of the zeppelin parts storage with our secretary, and then went back
    home.'
  - 'Blight: I can''t sleep for long because of those terrifying underground people.
    I fall asleep so late because of that, and I can''t get up to go to the factory
    to lock it.'
