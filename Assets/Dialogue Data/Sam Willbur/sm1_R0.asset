  dialogue:
  - "Store Manager: Glad to see you, Detective. I\u2019m Sam Wilbur, the gas manager
    of this factory. How can I help you?"
  - 'Odd: More information about you can help me.'
  - "Wilbur: I\u2019m the only child in my family. They passed away a long time ago.
    I love working hard. My goal is to be remembered by all, at least within the
    zeppelin factories. I live across the city, but being a manager for the first
    time is worth it."
