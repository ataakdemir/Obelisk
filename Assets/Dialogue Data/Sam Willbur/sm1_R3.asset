  dialogue:
  - 'Wilbur: I came to the factory very late. We checked the gas storage inventory
    with Coralie. I take care of the factory for Zefy.'
  - 'Odd: What did you do before coming to the factory?'
  - 'Wilbur: I had a meeting with a company. I made a deal with them to sell our
    gas tubes for a year. It was a good deal. I live across the city, so most of
    my time goes into transportation.'
  - 'Willbur: I use the zeppelin buses to travel, and their stops are terribly designed.
    As you know, our city is built on top of buildings.'
  - 'Willbur: Very specific places have streets and zeppelin stops, so travel is
    very strange here. I need to cross two buildings to get here from my zeppelin
    stop.'
