  dialogue:
  - "Wesley: He\u2019s terrible at his job. I don\u2019t know why the boss loves
    him so much. I\u2019m way better than him, but no. He probably died because of
    his own mistake."
  - "Wesley: Only I know how truly dumb he is. He\u2019s brainwashed everyone else
    with his sweet-talking, snake-like tongue. He even took a leaking gas tube we
    were about to throw away."
  - 'Wesley: We work with poisonous gases. That dumbass got himself killed. Case
    closed.'
  - 'Odd: Thanks, I guess.'
